      <h1>üåä The Voyage of Weihang</h1>
      <p>
        My name, Weihang (‰ºüËà™), means "great voyage" ‚Äî a name inspired in part by my father, whose name includes the character for "sea" (Êµ∑). 
        It reminds me that even when winds rise, if the heart stays calm, the ship stays steady.

    <h2>üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Swimming & Flow</h2>
    <p>
      I enjoy swimming. It‚Äôs not just exercise ‚Äî it‚Äôs meditation in motion. 
      The rhythm of breath and water lets me focus deeply and find peace in the present moment.
    </p>

    <h2>üìö A Lifelong Curiosity for Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Since childhood, I‚Äôve been fascinated by philosophy as a way of thinking and perceiving the world. 
      I was first drawn to <b>Wang Yangming's school of thought</b> in middle school and deeply resonated with the idea of unity between knowing and doing. 
      In university, I explored Western and modern philosophy through electives, gaining a more structured understanding of epistemology, ethics, and existentialism.
      Philosophy continues to shape how I think and live.
    </p>

    <h2>üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Meditation & Mental Resilience</h2>
    <p>
      Graduate school and early career life brought new forms of pressure and emotional swings. 
      That‚Äôs when I started meditating ‚Äî and stayed consistent. 
      Meditation helps me anchor myself, calm my mind, and observe thoughts with clarity. 
      It‚Äôs an ongoing practice, but one that constantly brings me back to balance.
    </p>

    <h2>‚ú® From Curiosity to Exploration</h2>
    <p>
      Whether it's data science or philosophy, my pursuit always begins with curiosity.
      I want to understand the world ‚Äî through tools, through thought, through experience. 
      I chose to study machine learning and LLMs because they offer new ways of perceiving and shaping the world.
      I read philosophy and practice meditation to explore the inner landscape.
